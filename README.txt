Lifting at Home Summer 2020
6/16/2020


With only weights available in kilograms, this quick funstion easily calculates
for me which plates I need to add on to the bars being used based on the load
I want to use in pounds.

I have 2 dumbbells and 1 barbell with 4 sizes of plates to add on to either
bar.  I measured the weight of the bars with a scale in pounds.

Maybe I'll know the metric system better soon, but for now this will do.
