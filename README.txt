Lifting at Home Summer 2020
6/16/2020


With only weights available in kilograms, this quick funstion easily calculates for me which plates I need to add on to the bars being used based on the load I want to use in pounds.

I have 2 dumbbells and 1 barbell with 4 sizes of plates to add on to either bar.  I measured the weight of the bars with a scale in pounds.
I used the greedy algorithm, and given the small amount of inputs I will be using this for, it works as optimal for the real use.  Of course, if needing the output for many more inputs, a recursive or DP algorithm could be used.


Maybe I'll know the metric system better soon, but for now this will do.
